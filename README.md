# A introduct to basic optimization algorithms

## Folders
- Introduct : this folder contains the power point document/presentation which named Optimization.pptx
- Code : this folder contains the algorithms introduced in the Optimization.pptx (but not all include)
- matopt : this folder includes some optimization algorithms on matrix functions, a simple matrix visulization pacakge is also in this folder. Any one who have interesting could have a look at: this folder includes some optimization algorithm on matrix functions, any one who have interesting could have a look at: https://github.com/CVPaul/MasterThesis

## Finally
- Almost all codes were writed in matlab 
- Code/convert\_gif\_images.py is a useful python scripts for .gif and .[jpg/png...] convertion while writting latext documents
